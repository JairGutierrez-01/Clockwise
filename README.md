## Why is this project important to me

Although this is not y individual project, i decided to share it because it represents something to me in my learning process.

It helped me to improve my knowladge in many areas like:

- Working with real development tools like Git, jira, Flask, Figma, etc.
- Frontend and backend collaboration
- writing professional documentation in LaTeX
- Understanding project structure, planning and testing

I was responsable mainly for the sections Teams and dashboard (frontend), a bit of backend integrations like APIs and functions, UX/UI, but the project was made possible through close team work and coordination. 


**Note:** This repository is only meant to reflect my personal learning experience and showcase my contributions.
